Trading on our swap is a simple, fast, and secure experience, designed to offer you maximum control and precision in your transactions. Here we explain step by step how to do it correctly:

🔹 1. View the market in real time
On the left side of the interface (UI), you'll find a live chart that will allow you to observe the token's behavior in real time. This tool is key to evaluating the best times to buy or sell, and even to plan an entry or exit strategy.

🔹 2. Connect your wallet
To start trading, you must first connect your wallet (such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet) to the Swap. Once connected, you'll be able to interact with all available trading pairs.

🔹 3. Select the token pair
In the interface, you'll see two fields:

"From": Here you select the token you want to use to buy or the one you want to sell.

"To": Here you select the token you wish to receive in exchange.

👉 For example: If you want to buy a token, enter the token you'll use (BNB, CORE, etc.) in "From" and the token you wish to acquire in "To."
If you want to sell, simply reverse the fields: enter the token you'll sell in "From" and the token you wish to receive in "To."

🔹 4. Adjust the slippage tolerance
Next to the pair, you'll see the tool icon ⚙️, which allows you to adjust the slippage tolerance. This is important, especially if the token you wish to trade has a transaction fee.

✅ General recommendation:

If the token has a 5% fee, enter a tolerance of at least 5.30%.

For greater execution security, you can enter 6%.
👉 Important: Even if you deposit 6%, the swap will only apply the percentage necessary to execute the trade. If the token charges 5%, only that amount will be deducted, no more.

🔹 5. Confirm the Trade
Once you've set everything up, click "Swap" and approve the transaction from your wallet. In seconds, the swap will be completed and you'll see your new balance reflected.

⚠️ Pro Tip
Before each trade, check the token's behavior on the chart. A well-thought-out strategy can make the difference between a good entry and a big profit.
